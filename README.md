# 👋 Hey, I'm Aaditya!
> *Coffee-hater. Systems nerd. AI dreamer.*

🚀 I'm a CS student building the **next generation of AI assistants**. Previously, I researched **workload-adaptive data structures** for high-performance databases. I’m also fascinated by **probabilistic data structures** and how they shape the future of computation.

🧠 I spend most of my time with **C/C++**, diving deep into systems programming and pushing the boundaries of performance.

📚 I love reading research papers — seriously, send me your favorite ones and let's talk!
